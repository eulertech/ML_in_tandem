# ML_in_tandem
ML framework for tandem model and verification process
This framework demonstrate the usage of blockchain in monitoring the data flow and machine model training to production integrity. Many times, you may have built a model with some configuration but during the deployment process, wrong information might be leaked in because of human error or some legacy platform file syncs. 
This is an attempt to address this problem.
